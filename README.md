# Full-stack-task

Hi Radiflow!
This is my solution for your full stack position task!

Sorry for the lagging response of the web, that's because of the free mongoDB servers. If you would like to, you could just create a local mongo database and insert it the COLORS.json file (server/src/colors/COLORS/json). 

If you do so, dont forget to uncomment the mongoDB local code line and comment the cluster one, call the data base ‚Äúfull-stack-task and the collection name should be ‚Äúcolors‚Äù (server/src/mongodb.mjs). üòä

Just clone the repo and hit *npm run dev* from the root folder.

Thank you!
