# Full-stack-task

Hi Radiflow!
This is my solution for your full stack position task!

Sorry for the lagging response, that's because of the mongoDB servers.
If you would like to, you could just create a local mongo database and insert it the COLORS.json file (server/src/colors/COLORS/json). If you do so, dont forget to uncommant the mongoDB local code line and commant the cluster one :) (server/src/mongodb.mjs)

Just clone the repo and hit *npm run dev*.

Thank you!
