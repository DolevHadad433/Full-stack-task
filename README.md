# Full-stack-task

Hi Radiflow!
This is my solution for your full stack position task!

Sorry for the lagging response, that's because of the mongoDB servers.
If you would like to, you could just create a local mongo database and insert it the COLORS.json file (server/src/colors/COLORS/json)

Just clone the repo and hit *npm run dev*.

Thank you!
